	<h2>About</h2>
	
	<div id = "about">
		<p>Located in Upstate New York, the Adirondack Park is best known for its expansive pristine forests, lakes, rivers, and outdoor recreation opportunities. Unlike a national park, the Adirondack Park has no entrance and no entry fee, as it not only contains public land, but private lands as well where people live year-round.
		<br><br>
		There are more than 200 lakes around the mountains, including Lake George, Lake Placid, and Lake Tear of the Clouds, which is the source of the Hudson River. The Adirondack Region is also home to hundreds of mountain summits, with some reaching heights of 5,000 feet or more.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Climate</h2>
		<div id = "climate">
		<p>
		The climate is strongly continental, with high humidity and precipitation year-round. The Adirondacks typically experience pleasantly warm, rainy weather in the summer (June–August), with temperatures in the range of 66–73 °F. 
		<br><br>
		Summer evenings in the Adirondacks are chilly, with temperatures ranging on average between 45–54 °F.
		<br><br>
		Winters (December–March) are long, cold, snowy and harsh, with temperatures ranging from 18 to 23 °F. Winter nights are frigid, with temperatures between −2 and 4 °F.
		<br><br>
		Spring (April–May) and fall (September–November) are short transitional seasons.
