<h2>Welcome to the future of education. Your education.</h2>

A few years ago, Georgia Gwinnett College was home to just over 100 students. Let’s just say – things have changed. What was once 261 acres of rolling terrain has become the perfect metropolitan college campus of 11,627 students. What’s so perfect about it? GGC adapts to how you do things – your learning style, your work schedule and your life. From the ground up, GGC was designed to help you succeed. That's game changing.

<h2>Founded</h2>
In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year college. So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and designated it specifically for the development of a college campus. GGC opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia in more than 100 years, and the first four-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the University System of Georgia.

<h2 id = "location">Location</h2>
The College is located in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in the heart of Gwinnett County. Gwinnett is a vibrant community 30 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta where a mixture of quiet postcard neighborhoods and bustling commercial districts blend the past with the present. Here, progress and quality of life connect so that everyone enjoys the small town ambience with all the amenities of a big city. Businesses and residents alike enjoy safe neighborhoods, good schools, modern infrastructure and a thriving economy. 

Gwinnett County remains one of the most dynamic regions in the South to live and work with an estimated population of about 896,000 with 1.2 million projected by the year 2025.
